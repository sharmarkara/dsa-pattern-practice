Array: An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations,
indexed starting from 0.

Declaration & Initialization:

Int[] arr= new int[5];
int[] arr2= {1,2,3,4,5};

Array patterns to remember:
1. Two pointer Approach(For sorted Arrays & Pair Problems)
Definition: The Two Pointer technique is an optimization method used to process pairs of elements
in an array or string by using two pointers instead of nested loops.

--> Helps reduce time complexity from O(N)^2---->O(N).
--> Used for searching,sorting,merging,partition
