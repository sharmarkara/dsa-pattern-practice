-->Two Pointer: The two pointer is an optimization method used to process pairs of elements
in an array or string by using two pointers instead of using nested loops.

>> Help reduce time complexity from O(N)^2 --->O(N).
>> Used for searching, sorting, merging, partitioning, and subarray problems.

-->Types of two pointer approach
1. Opposite direction pointers:
    * Used when dealing with sorted arrays.
    * Common for finding pairs(e.g., sum problems,palindrome, two-sum in sorted array).

2. Same direction pointers:
    * Used for traversing and modifying elements efficiently.
    * Common in merging, removing duplicates, and longest subarray problems.

--> Opposite direction two pointer example:
* Problem: Check if a given string is palindrome.

Approach:
1. Use two pointers: left pointer(l) at the beginning and right pointer(r) at the end.
2. Compare characters at both pointers.
3. Move pointers inward until they meet.

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)

--> Same direction two pointer example:
* Problem: remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place and return the new length.

Approach:

1. Use two pointers:
    * i(slow pointer) tracks the last unique element.
    * j(fast pointer) scans for new unique elements.

2. When arr[j] =/ arr[i], move the unique element forward.

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)

** Key points to Remember:
-->  Two pointers optimize O(N)^2 problems to O(N).
-->  Use opposite pointers for sum/palindrome problems.
-->  Use same-directions pointers for merging and modifying.
-->  Works best with sorted arrays and contiguous subarrays.
